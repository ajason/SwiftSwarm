///
/// `AgentRepresentable` ensures that conforming types can be iterated over (via `CaseIterable`),
/// represented by a raw value (via `RawRepresentable`), and associated with an `Agent` instance.
///
/// This is useful for creating enums or other structures that represent different agents in the system.

   /// such as model, instructions, and custom tools.

   /// property when making run requests.
